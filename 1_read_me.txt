These R-scripts execute the simulation study.

Scripts with "none_and_medium" in the name contain conditions of "none" and "medium" effects between groups.

Scripts with "high" in the name contain conditions of "high" effects between groups.

Scripts with "abs" in the name contain comparisons of absolute variances and correlations.

Scripts with "rel" in the name contain conditions of relative variances (ICCs).

Comparisons of relative variances (ICCs) are distributed across several scripts,
because a different population model is created for every ICC:
"a":  comparisons for assimilation
"c":  comparison for consensus
"u":  comparison for uniqueness
"cp": comparison for person-level-exclusive consensus

The script "analyze_results" analyzes the results.
